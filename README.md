# Code examples
This repository contains some of my code examples

## Content
- [denovo-assembly-low-cov.sh](denovo-assembly-low-cov.sh) - contains a pipeline for de novo assembly of genomes from low-coverage long reads (ONT).
- [ML operon prediction.ipynb](<ML operon prediction.ipynb>) - contains Jupyter notebook for ML prediction (RF, Python3) of operonic pairs in Bifidobacterium sp. genomes based on B. breve operonic pairs info.
- [ML data preparation.ipynb](<ML data preparation.ipynb>) - contains Jupyter notebook for data preparation (calculation of intragenic distances, GO semantic similarity, phylogenetic distances and presence of upstream terminator/promoter) for the operonic pairs ML prediction.
